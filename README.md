In computer science ,a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.Where as an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. We combine this data structures and alogorithms to get a proper funtioning program. Data structure and algorithms help in understanding the nature of the problem at a deeper level and thereby a better understanding of the world.Data structure and algorithms help in understanding the nature of the problem at a deeper level and thereby a better understanding of the world,Major advantage of data structure is it can help programmer save lots of time or processing time while operations such as storage, retrieval or processing of data.
